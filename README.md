# Pyth

- Output can be either sqlite or csv (for version 0.0.1)
- Primarily just a utility for something that I'm working on
- Should not be very complex. Keep it simple, just do what it needs to do
- Does not keep the timestamps
- Potentially give the option to not write the output, just keep in memory
