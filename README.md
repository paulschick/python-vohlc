# Python VOHLC

Version 0.0.1

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Creates Volume-based candlesticks from time-based ohlcv data retrieved from cryptocurrency exchanges.

- Output can be either sqlite or csv (for version 0.0.1)
- Primarily just a utility for something that I'm working on
- Should not be very complex. Keep it simple, just do what it needs to do
- Does not keep the timestamps
- Potentially give the option to not write the output, just keep in memory

## Installation

You may install from source, or install from pypi:

```shell
pip install vohlc
```
